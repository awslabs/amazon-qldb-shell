# QLDB CLI Shell

## About

This is the specification of the QLDB Shell containing all features, commands, and options. Note that this is not yet
completely implemented and is a work-progress-subject to change. As features become reality, this content will become
the user guide.

## Tenets

**Unless you know better ones.**

* We adhere to the principle of least astonishment
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). That is, a
  shell should behave the way most customers expect it to behave, which will be
  very similar to the way in which all the other shells they've ever used
  behaves.
    * This isn't just â€œintention". During a design review for a new feature if
      something "surprises" you, that is a good indicator it's probably not
      right.
* We don't need to invent unless it doesn't exist.
    * Database shells have been around for more than 20 years. In most cases we
      should just do whatever it is that the MySQL/Postgres shells do.
* We favor compatibility with other shells, so for example, I can pipe the
  output of the QLDB shell to another program, like jq.

## CLI

We support using the shell as an executable which can receive input and pipe
output to other applications, so for example:

```sh
cat my-script.sql > qldbshell -f json -e | jq
```

Would pipe the results of executing the script in the script file into the jq
program. All possible arguments are:

```sh
Usage:
-m --display-metrics [on|off] # default: on
-f --format [ion|json|table] # default: ion

-a --auto-commit [on|off] # default: on

-p --endpoint endpoint # default: taken from credentials
-l --ledger ledger # default: none

-P --prompt your-prompt-syntax # default: qldb>
-d --delimiter your-delimiter # default: \n
-t --terminator-required # default: unspecified and therefore false
-o --output [STDOUT|file] [outfile]? # default: console

-h --history [on|off] [file]? # default: on ~/.qldb/command-history
-l --history-limit [0-9]+ # default: 10000

-e --execute ["text"|script-file|STDIN]
```

## Command interface

Users can type three types of entries into the shell:

1. [PartiQL statements](https://partiql.org/)., 
2. Database commands, and
3. Shell commands.

### PartiQL statements
These statements are any PartiQL syntax. Everything that is not a database or meta-command will be assumed to be a 
PartiQL statement. These queries will be captured as is and sent to the server for evaluation with the results returned 
and displayed in the specified format.

### Database commands
These commands are specifically limited to those specified here and relate to the principle of least astonishment.
These are the types of commands users will be used to seeing in other database shells. These aren't queries and cannot
be executed by the database query engine, rather they are commands at the level of the database itself, rather than
the data in the database.

* `start transaction` or `begin`
  * This starts a transaction. If we are in auto-commit mode, the shell reports a warning saying that this has no 
    effect. 
* `commit`
  * This commits a transaction. If there is no transaction in progress, the shell reports an error saying that there is 
    no active transaction. If we are in auto-commit mode, the command is accepted and no error or warning or information
    is reported.
* `abort`
  * This aborts a transaction. If there is no transaction in progress, the shell reports an error saying that there is
    no active transaction. If we are in auto-commit mode, the command is accepted and no error or warning or information
    is reported.
* `help`
  * Prints the lists of database and meta commands.
* `quit` or `exit`
  * Quits the shell.

### Shell Meta Commands

All commands to the shell itself will be prefixed with a backslash (\), e.g:

* `\quit`
  * Quits the shell. This can be preceded by the backslash or not.
* `\help`
  * Prints the lists of meta commands. This can be preceded by the backslash or not.
* `\use [ledger|endpoint] ledger-or-endpoint`
  * Connect to a different endpoint or ledger.
* `\show [ledgers|tables]`
  * Display a list of tables in the current ledger, or ledgers at the current endpoint, depending on the command
    arguments.
* `\status`
  * Prints out things like connection status, server ping latency, etc.
* `\option [option-name]=[option-value]`. Sets an option to the value, valid options are:
  * `metrics=[on|off|last]`
    * Determines whether or not metrics will be emitted after the results of a query are shown.
    * last prints out the last known metrics from your previous command.
  * `query-results-format=[ion|json|table|csv]`
    * `ion`: Prints the objects from the database as ION documents in text.
    * `json`: Prints the objects from the database as JSON documents in text.
    * `table`: Tabulates the data and prints out the data as rows.
    * `csv`: Prints out the data in CSV format.
  * `auto-commit=[on|off]`
    * Determines whether each statement will be executed as a transaction or
      not. By default this is on, meaning that statements are all executed as
      individual transactions.
  * `delimiter=delimiter-characters`
    * Specify the delimiter for end of command processing, such as `\n` or `;`.
  * `output="[STDOUT|output-file]"`
    * Write results either into a file which you specify, or to STDOUT. If running in scripted mode, this outputs to 
    * `STDOUT` by default.
  * `prompt=<your-prompt-syntax>`
    * Sets your prompt to your desired value.
  * `terminator-required=[true|false]`
    * Sets the terminator-required option. See [here](#line-terminators) for details.
* `\history [limit]`
  * Print out the last limit commands executed.
* `\env`
  * Prints out your current environment settings including where they were set from.

### Line terminators

The way to indicate to the shell that you are done with a command is by pressing the ENTER key. Some SQL data miners 
using shells regularly type out long commands and separating this over multiple lines is natural. For these
users they can change their terminator to be required and set the command
delimiter to be semi-colon (;) as follows:

```
\terminator-required true
\delimiter ;
```

`\terminator-required` indicates that pressing the enter key at the end of a
line of input will not execute the command by itself. If they did that some
sample output would look like this:

```
qldb> select * from person
    -> ...
```

Alternately, if you end your statement with a semi-colon (`;`) you will execute
the statement:

```
qldb> \query-results-format table
qldb> select * from Person;
+------+------+-------------+
| name | age  | age.measure |
+------+------+-------------+
| Ian  |  44  | years       |
+------+------+-------------+
1 document in bag (read-ios: 1, server-time: 3ms, total-time: 4ms)
```

We support readline, so things like up-arrow, i-search, CTRL-D work as expected.

### Comments

Any statement that starts with a hash (`#`) will be ignored as a comment.

## Customizing your display

You can use the `\prompt` command to customize your prompt and this can be saved
in your `~/.qldb/shell.conf` file.

```sh
\prompt qldb
qldb> # this is the default

\prompt ${ledger-name}/${database-name}-${transaction-id}>
PeopleLedger/PeopleDatabase-(a-transaction-id)> ...
```

## Configuration

All possible configuration options are settable on the command line or in a conf
file using the standard MySQL
(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/option-files.html) or Git
(https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config/2.1.4) syntax (TOML
(https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)). The format is as follows:

```
[section]
option[ = value]? [# comments]?
[# comments]?

Full options are as follows:

[metrics]
display = [on|off] # default: on

[results]
format = [ion|json|table|csv] # default: ion

[transactions]
auto-commit = [on|off] # default: on

[connection]
endpoint = default-endpoint # default: taken from credentials
ledger = default-ledger # default: none

[interface]
prompt = your-prompt-syntax # default: qldb>
terminator-required = [true|false] # default: false
delimiter = your-statement-delimiter # default: ;
output = [console|file] [outfile]? # default: console

[history]
record-commands = [on|off] [file]? # default: on ~/.qldb/command-history
limit = [0-9]+ # default: 10000
```

The default config file will be found at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qldbshell/default_config.toml`. For example on OSX this will
typically be at `/Users/username/Library/Application Support/qldbshell/default_config.toml`.

## Transactions

Following MySQL's lead, starting a transaction uses the following statement
(which is not currently reserved in PartiQL):

```
qldb> \query-results-format table
qldb> start transaction;
+------------------+
| transactionId    |
+------------------+
| a-transaction-id |
+------------------+
1 document in set (total-time: 1.03ms)
qldb> select * from Person;
+------+------+
| name | age  |
+------+------+
| Ian  |  44  |
+------+------+
1 document in bag (read-ios: 1, server-time: 3.14ms, total-time: 3.59ms)
qldb> commit;
transaction a-transaction-id committed (read-ios: 1, server-time: 1.31ms, total-time: 1.4ms)
```

In MySQL begin is an alias for start transaction but it is not recommended as
start transaction is standard SQL syntax. We will not implement a begin alias
for starting a transaction unless a customer asks for it to avoid possible
complications with the begin...end compound statement found in PL/ and T-SQL.

## Query Metrics

By default query metrics are enabled. They print as a simple statement after your results:

```
qldb> select * from Person;
{
  name: "Ian",
  age: 44
}
1 document in bag (read-ios: 1, server-time: 3.14ms, total-time: 3.59ms)
```

You can turn them off with \metrics off.

## Unsupported

We deliberately will not support things from MySQL that we don't feel should come with you to a QLDB world. Such as:

```
select .. into outfile
```

We will not extend PartiQL syntax for CLI specific functionality, we intend to
use commands for that.
